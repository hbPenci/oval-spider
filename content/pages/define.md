      - content: "The Y axis represents how **visible** the practice is to those who have the need. If they interact with, or play a part in the practice then it is positioned near the top or is it something that they do not even know exists, therefore positioned further down.\n\nThe X\_ axis represents how **mature** a practice is. This is defined in four stages, Concept, Emerging, Good and Best. To help with positioning we use the following guides:\n\n*   Concept: Aware of/experimenting with the practice.\n\n*   Emerging: Getting to grips with/getting some value from the practice\n\n*   Good: Doing some aspects of the practice repeatedly but still needs improvement\n\n*   Best: Doing all aspects of the practice consistently, unlikely to need focused improvement effort and could be considered an exemplar.\n"

      - subtitle: What the symbols mean
        content: "On the map itself we visualise capabilities as **squares** and link them to other maps that describe the practices that compose it.\n\nPractices are **circles**.\_ Practises are things you can describe and observe the act of.\_ Practises integrate together to form capabilities.\n\n**Lines** that connect the practices represent the relationships between the practices. These can range from a need a practice has on another to a shared element of practice (meaning, material or skills).\n\nWhen the line is **broken** this suggests a poor connection e.g. a poor flow of information.\_\n"

      - subtitle: Patterns of movement and change
        content: >
          Arrows show intended movement and they come in four flavours:


          1.  **Develop**: A movement to the right visualises the intention to
          improve the practice is, well, practiced.


          2.  **Reconfigure**: A movement to the left that notes a significant
          change in the skills required, the tools used or the intention of the
          practice. This movement suggests the way in which the practice is done
          is likely to get worse before it gets better.


          3.  **Expose**: A movement upwards that suggests that the practice
          needs to be made more visible to the customer, potentially increase
          the interaction with the customer through this practice.


          4.  **Hide**: A movement downwards that suggests the practice should
          be less visible to the customer


          \--------------


          Adding new practices to the map are done two ways:


          1.  **Compete**: This is when a new practice is added to the map to
          challenge, and potentially remove, another practice in the belief that
          more value can be delivered from the new practice.


          2.  **Introduce**: This is a new practice that we believe will add to
          the overall capability that map represents.
