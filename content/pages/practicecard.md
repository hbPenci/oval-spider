    title: Define a Maturity Map Practice Card
    content: >
      At the core of any activity in any business or service are practices. We
      perform practices to get the work done. Both social and material aspects
      are relevant when we want to understand how the work works. Capturing
      practices focuses the observation and analysis on activity, not the actor.

          The practice card is an artefact that captures the essence of a
          practice.
        content: "At the very least it requires three attributes:\_\n\n1.  **Meaning: **why are we using this practice, what is its purpose, what outcome and value do we reproduce by performing the practice\n\n2.  **Material: **what do we need to perform the practice, what tools, infrastructure, facilities or equipment do we need to have access to in order to perform the practice\n\n3.  **Doing it Well: **what does it look like when this practice is performed well, what do we expect to see, what has the practitioner learned to perform the practice\n\nDepending on the context and the nature of the desired analysis, it can be beneficial to add further attributes, for example:\n\n*   How are we measuring the practice (e.g. how does it account for KPI or OKR scores)\n\n*   What are its inputs and outputs\n\nWe can also further differentiate an attribute into multiple attributes, for example distinguishing skills for a skill liquidity analysis.\_\n\nThe idea of a practice card is to facilitate discussion and to confirm a shared understanding\_ amongst the people who perform the practice in a shared context. Such discussions can be useful to align practices, to guide the conversation when inducting people who join the organisation or when seeking help from experts. In order to do so, it is essential to keep the card simple. It cannot replace the social interaction necessary to share a practice and making it too detailed will make it painful to maintain. It has to be as short as possible, but no shorter.\_\n\nAs a capability is the integration of practices, practice cards provide the required level of detail when we’re seeking to improve or change such integration. If we want to change a material, e.g. apply a new technology or method, how does it align with the network of practices, what do we have to do to make it fit with existing material. Can we extract the expected value, given how we’re currently doing things. All these aspects of change can be better explored with practice cards.\n"
