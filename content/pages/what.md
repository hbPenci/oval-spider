      - content: "Maturity is the consistency of performance and coherence of integration of the practises that compose a capability.\_ That is,\_Maturity can be thought of as the assessment of the consistency in performing the capability or practise and its coherence of integration with other capabilities or practises, and how improving its performance and integration creates more value for the organisation. I.e. we can consider a practise or capability as mature if any of the possible improvements would not create more value for the organisation in the current context. \n"

        content: >
          Maturity Maps are a condensed visualisation of the network of
          capabilities and practices that organisations and teams use to meet
          the needs of their customers (and/or stakeholders). In maps space and
          position on the map have meaning. Capabilities and practices are
          positioned based on their maturity and visibility. This then allows us
          to see where they can and should move in order to improve the overall
          outcome by identifying what changes hold the most promise of improving
          the value to the organisation.
