  Maturity Mapping can be scaled to fit the desired size.

The short answer is that it depends on the problem we are trying to solve. Maturity Mapping can be scaled to fit the desired size. 

A single half day mapping session with a small team around a focused problem can produce new insights and options for improvement. To map the capabilities in an agile software team usually requires 3 workshops of 2-3 hours each when facilitated by a Maturity Mapping expert, plus maybe half a day for the analysis and clean up of the artefacts, if that is desirable. 

Investigating the problems in cloud adoption for an operational team serving 8 product teams (i.e. 9 teams of various sizes) can be done in a month. Including experiments into the time frame of the mapping exercise can stretch this to 6-7 weeks of work carried out over a period of 3-4 months (depending on the time it takes to carry out the experiments), with most of the facilitated workshops happening in the 1st half. 

For any multi-team engagement, time with the leadership will be required as well, up front to scope and plan the engagement, during the actual mapping activity to reframe some of the scope of the engagement based on the feedback from early mapping sessions and at the end to reflect on what was discovered and how to apply it going forward. Again, these need to be facilitated workshops, so add 2-4 weeks for that.
