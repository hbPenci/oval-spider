That’s really a question that can only be answered in context. A first factor is: how quickly can you change your practices? Keep in mind that the map is an abstraction of how you really meet the need and its purpose is to facilitate discussions about how we can better meet that need, so how often are you having these discussions? When is it useful to reflect on how you could improve your practices again? Don’t update the map just for an update’s sake, i.e. don’t make it bureaucratic.
