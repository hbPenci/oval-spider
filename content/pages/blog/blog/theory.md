  That’s really a question that can only be answered in context. A first factor
  is: how quickly can you change your practices?

Maturity Mapping is based on [Practice Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_theory) and uses [Simon Wardley’s mapping technique](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/07/what-makes-map.html) as its main visualisation method. We were specifically inspired by [Social Practice theory](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-dynamics-of-social-practice-everyday-life-and-how-it-changes\(6ba37d6d-5a7a-4f02-b7b1-e734ab36ff0c\)/export.html). It sits within the domain of socio-technical research and analysis and has been influenced by Design (the academic type, as well as some other applications of Design), but we do not claim to be Designers. It has grown out of our own practice as organisational coaches and consultants. We use models from complexity and network research to inform experiments, e.g. [Cynefin](https://cynefin.io/index.php/Main_Page).

Using the lens of practice theory, we could say that Wardley Mapping has a bias for the *material*, for the “thingness” of what is being mapped and Maturity Mapping has bias for *doing*, the socio-material enactments that enable the things. As Maturity Mapping evolves, we expect that deviation to become more articulate. We are relying on Simon’s technique because we have not (yet) found a better visualisation for maturing practices.

Social Practice Theory aims to describe a practice by inspecting three elements:

*   Meaning

*   Material

*   Competences

By *Meaning*\* \*\*\*we mean to inspect why we are performing the practice. What is its purpose? What outcome does it aim to achieve? What value does it have for practitioners, but also what value does it add to the organisation, its stakeholders and customers. 

Under *Material*\* \*\*\*we mean any physical (and sometimes even meta-physcial) material that is necessary to perform a practice. A practice is performed in a physical space at specific times as an interaction with material (e.g. technology). 

With *Competences* we mean any kind of knowledge, *knowing of*, as well as *knowing how*, that is necessary to perform the practice. This includes skills, knowledge of reference systems, categorisations, policies, domain knowledge, social knowledge etc. 

When capturing practice cards, we usually focus on these core elements to the extent that the information is or could be relevant to the problem we explore. Friction can then be observed when either \*Meanings, Materials \*or *Competences* (or, of course, a combination thereof) between connected practices do not align. The information from the cards will inform the discussion of how better alignment could be found between those practitioners.   

On the practice card, we decided to replace asking explicitly for competences by asking for “Doing it well’. Answering the question allows us to think about positioning the practice on the Evolution axis as well as implicitly asking for competences. 

We often can also describe capabilities with these three elements, which can help understand friction between capabilities. There is a somewhat fractal nature to the lens of practice. We can configure practices into capabilities and practices themselves can often be seen as configurations of smaller practices (e.g. tacit practices or routinized behaviours). Capabilities can then be seen as a higher order system emerging from integrated practices, where their meaning will be different, sometimes transformatively so, but the materials and most required competences will be the same as in the underlying practices. 

Regarding Simon’s mapping technique, we believe that Maturity Maps are Wardley Maps, i.e. satisfy his criteria for a map, but what we’re mapping is informed by practice theory, i.e. we are taking a different approach than Simon suggests for practices. 

Using the lens of practice theory, we could say that Wardley Mapping has a bias for the *material*, for the “thingness” of what is being mapped and Maturity Mapping has bias for *doing*, the socio-material enactments that enable the things. As Maturity Mapping evolves, we expect that deviation to become more articulate. We are relying on Simon’s technique because we have not (yet) found a better visualisation for maturing practices.
