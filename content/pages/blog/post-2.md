  Ideally, find someone who can facilitate the process who is not part of the
  organisation (or organisations) in which you are mapping. This is to minimise
  bias in the facilitation itself.

Ideally, find someone who can facilitate the process who is not part of the organisation (or organisations) in which you are mapping. This is to minimise bias in the facilitation itself. 

Start by having a good problem statement (or statements) to frame the scope of the exercise, what needs are to be explored and know who has those needs (because you should consult them when validating if improvements were achieved). If possible, you should capture some hypotheses around what you expect to observe on the maps you intend to make. 

We suggest starting with collecting the practices that are performed to meet that need on practice cards. Depending on the problem, you might want to add specific attributes for these practices, but make sure you keep the three core attributes (Meaning, Material, How to do it well). 

Then place the practices on the map and connect them, they should build a network. If you get a linear, or close to linear, connection of practices, you are likely to have missed important aspects of how the need is met. You might need to observe how the work is getting done to discover these. You want to make all practices that are needed to meet the need visible.
