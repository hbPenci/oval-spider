      - title: How will it make me new money?
        content: "Discover new ways of interacting with customers and the wider environment in which the organisation operates by locating friction between practices and/or capabilities in meeting these needs.\_\_\n\nAllow emergence of new capabilities by setting direction (e.g. articulating a new yet unmet need, i.e. new meaning) and using Maturity Mapping to play through new combinations of existing practices and capabilities to meet that need. In combination with carrying out experiments, this is a deliberate form of exaptation (and making exapting a practice in itself). \_ \n"
      - title: How long does it take?
        content: "The short answer is that it depends on the problem we are trying to solve. Maturity Mapping can be scaled to fit the desired size.\_\n\nA single half day mapping session with a small team around a focused problem can produce new insights and options for improvement. To map the capabilities in an agile software team usually requires 3 workshops of 2-3 hours each when facilitated by a Maturity Mapping expert, plus maybe half a day for the analysis and clean up of the artefacts, if that is desirable.\_\n\nInvestigating the problems in cloud adoption for an operational team serving 8 product teams (i.e. 9 teams of various sizes) can be done in a month. Including experiments into the time frame of the mapping exercise can stretch this to 6-7 weeks of work carried out over a period of 3-4 months (depending on the time it takes to carry out the experiments), with most of the facilitated workshops happening in the 1st half.\_\n\nFor any multi-team engagement, time with the leadership will be required as well, up front to scope and plan the engagement, during the actual mapping activity to reframe some of the scope of the engagement based on the feedback from early mapping sessions and at the end to reflect on what was discovered and how to apply it going forward. Again, these need to be facilitated workshops, so add 2-4 weeks for that. \n"
      - title: What’s roughly the process?
        content: "Ideally, find someone who can facilitate the process who is not part of the organisation (or organisations) in which you are mapping. This is to minimise bias in the facilitation itself.\_\n\nStart by having a good problem statement (or statements) to frame the scope of the exercise, what needs are to be explored and know who has those needs (because you should consult them when validating if improvements were achieved). If possible, you should capture some hypotheses around what you expect to observe on the maps you intend to make.\_\n\nWe suggest starting with collecting the practices that are performed to meet that need on practice cards. Depending on the problem, you might want to add specific attributes for these practices, but make sure you keep the three core attributes (Meaning, Material, How to do it well).\_\n\nThen place the practices on the map and connect them, they should build a network. If you get a linear, or close to linear, connection of practices, you are likely to have missed important aspects of how the need is met. You might need to observe how the work is getting done to discover these. You want to make all practices that are needed to meet the need visible. \n"
      - title: How frequently should I do it?
        content: >
          That’s really a question that can only be answered in context. A first
          factor is: how quickly can you change your practices? Keep in mind
          that the map is an abstraction of how you really meet the need and its
          purpose is to facilitate discussions about how we can better meet that
          need, so how often are you having these discussions? When is it useful
          to reflect on how you could improve your practices again? Don’t update
          the map just for an update’s sake, i.e. don’t make it bureaucratic. 
      - title: What’s the theory behind it?
        subtitle: lorem-ipsum
        title_align: left
        content: "Maturity Mapping is based on [Practice Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_theory) and uses [Simon Wardley’s mapping technique](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/07/what-makes-map.html) as its main visualisation method. We were specifically inspired by [Social Practice theory](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-dynamics-of-social-practice-everyday-life-and-how-it-changes\\(6ba37d6d-5a7a-4f02-b7b1-e734ab36ff0c\\)/export.html). It sits within the domain of socio-technical research and analysis and has been influenced by Design (the academic type, as well as some other applications of Design), but we do not claim to be Designers. It has grown out of our own practice as organisational coaches and consultants. We use models from complexity and network research to inform experiments, e.g. [Cynefin](https://cynefin.io/index.php/Main_Page).\n\nUsing the lens of practice theory, we could say that Wardley Mapping has a bias for the *material*, for the “thingness” of what is being mapped and Maturity Mapping has bias for *doing*, the socio-material enactments that enable the things. As Maturity Mapping evolves, we expect that deviation to become more articulate. We are relying on Simon’s technique because we have not (yet) found a better visualisation for maturing practices. \n\nSocial Practice Theory aims to describe a practice by inspecting three elements:\n\n*   Meaning\n\n*   Material\n\n*   Competences\n\nBy *Meaning** ***we mean to inspect why we are performing the practice. What is its purpose? What outcome does it aim to achieve? What value does it have for practitioners, but also what value does it add to the organisation, its stakeholders and customers.\_\n\nUnder *Material** ***we mean any physical (and sometimes even meta-physcial) material that is necessary to perform a practice. A practice is performed in a physical space at specific times as an interaction with material (e.g. technology).\_\n\nWith *Competences* we mean any kind of knowledge, *knowing of*, as well as *knowing how*, that is necessary to perform the practice. This includes skills, knowledge of reference systems, categorisations, policies, domain knowledge, social knowledge etc.\_\n\nWhen capturing practice cards, we usually focus on these core elements to the extent that the information is or could be relevant to the problem we explore. Friction can then be observed when either *Meanings, Materials *or *Competences* (or, of course, a combination thereof) between connected practices do not align. The information from the cards will inform the discussion of how better alignment could be found between those practitioners.\_\_\_\n\nOn the practice card, we decided to replace asking explicitly for competences by asking for “Doing it well’. Answering the question allows us to think about positioning the practice on the Evolution axis as well as implicitly asking for competences.\_\n\nWe often can also describe capabilities with these three elements, which can help understand friction between capabilities. There is a somewhat fractal nature to the lens of practice. We can configure practices into capabilities and practices themselves can often be seen as configurations of smaller practices (e.g. tacit practices or routinized behaviours). Capabilities can then be seen as a higher order system emerging from integrated practices, where their meaning will be different, sometimes transformatively so, but the materials and most required competences will be the same as in the underlying practices.\_\n\nRegarding Simon’s mapping technique, we believe that Maturity Maps are Wardley Maps, i.e. satisfy his criteria for a map, but what we’re mapping is informed by practice theory, i.e. we are taking a different approach than Simon suggests for practices.\_\n"
