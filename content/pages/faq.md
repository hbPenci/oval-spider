      - title: How will it make me new money?
        content: "Discover new ways of interacting with customers and the wider environment in which the organisation operates by locating friction between practices and/or capabilities in meeting these needs.\_\_\n\nAllow emergence of new capabilities by setting direction (e.g. articulating a new yet unmet need, i.e. new meaning) and using Maturity Mapping to play through new combinations of existing practices and capabilities to meet that need. In combination with carrying out experiments, this is a deliberate form of exaptation (and making exapting a practice in itself). \_ \n"
      - title: How long does it take?
        content: "The short answer is that it depends on the problem we are trying to solve. Maturity Mapping can be scaled to fit the desired size.\_\n\nA single half day mapping session with a small team around a focused problem can produce new insights and options for improvement. To map the capabilities in an agile software team usually requires 3 workshops of 2-3 hours each when facilitated by a Maturity Mapping expert, plus maybe half a day for the analysis and clean up of the artefacts, if that is desirable.\_\n\nInvestigating the problems in cloud adoption for an operational team serving 8 product teams (i.e. 9 teams of various sizes) can be done in a month. Including experiments into the time frame of the mapping exercise can stretch this to 6-7 weeks of work carried out over a period of 3-4 months (depending on the time it takes to carry out the experiments), with most of the facilitated workshops happening in the 1st half.\_\n\nFor any multi-team engagement, time with the leadership will be required as well, up front to scope and plan the engagement, during the actual mapping activity to reframe some of the scope of the engagement based on the feedback from early mapping sessions and at the end to reflect on what was discovered and how to apply it going forward. Again, these need to be facilitated workshops, so add 2-4 weeks for that. \n"
      - title: What’s roughly the process?
        content: "Ideally, find someone who can facilitate the process who is not part of the organisation (or organisations) in which you are mapping. This is to minimise bias in the facilitation itself.\_\n\nStart by having a good problem statement (or statements) to frame the scope of the exercise, what needs are to be explored and know who has those needs (because you should consult them when validating if improvements were achieved). If possible, you should capture some hypotheses around what you expect to observe on the maps you intend to make.\_\n\nWe suggest starting with collecting the practices that are performed to meet that need on practice cards. Depending on the problem, you might want to add specific attributes for these practices, but make sure you keep the three core attributes (Meaning, Material, How to do it well).\_\n\nThen place the practices on the map and connect them, they should build a network. If you get a linear, or close to linear, connection of practices, you are likely to have missed important aspects of how the need is met. You might need to observe how the work is getting done to discover these. You want to make all practices that are needed to meet the need visible. \n"
      - title: How frequently should I do it?
        content: >
          That’s really a question that can only be answered in context. A first
          factor is: how quickly can you change your practices? Keep in mind
          that the map is an abstraction of how you really meet the need and its
          purpose is to facilitate discussions about how we can better meet that
          need, so how often are you having these discussions? When is it useful
          to reflect on how you could improve your practices again? Don’t update
          the map just for an update’s sake, i.e. don’t make it bureaucratic. 
      - title: What’s the theory behind it?
        title_align: left
        content: "Maturity Mapping is based on [Practice Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_theory) and uses [Simon Wardley’s mapping technique](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/07/what-makes-map.html) as its main visualisation method. We were specifically inspired by [Social Practice theory](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-dynamics-of-social-practice-everyday-life-and-how-it-changes\\(6ba37d6d-5a7a-4f02-b7b1-e734ab36ff0c\\)/export.html). It sits within the domain of socio-technical research and analysis and has been influenced by Design (the academic type, as well as some other applications of Design), but we do not claim to be Designers. It has grown out of our own practice as organisational coaches and consultants. We use models from complexity and network research to inform experiments, e.g. [Cynefin](https://cynefin.io/index.php/Main_Page).\n\nUsing the lens of practice theory, we could say that Wardley Mapping has a bias for the *material*, for the “thingness” of what is being mapped and Maturity Mapping has bias for *doing*, the socio-material enactments that enable the things. As Maturity Mapping evolves, we expect that deviation to become more articulate. We are relying on Simon’s technique because we have not (yet) found a better visualisation for maturing practices.\n\nSocial Practice Theory aims to describe a practice by inspecting three elements:\n\n*   Meaning\n\n*   Material\n\n*   Competences\n\nBy *Meaning*\\* \\*\\*\\*we mean to inspect why we are performing the practice. What is its purpose? What outcome does it aim to achieve? What value does it have for practitioners, but also what value does it add to the organisation, its stakeholders and customers.\_\n\nUnder *Material*\\* \\*\\*\\*we mean any physical (and sometimes even meta-physcial) material that is necessary to perform a practice. A practice is performed in a physical space at specific times as an interaction with material (e.g. technology).\_\n\nWith *Competences* we mean any kind of knowledge, *knowing of*, as well as *knowing how*, that is necessary to perform the practice. This includes skills, knowledge of reference systems, categorisations, policies, domain knowledge, social knowledge etc.\_\n\nWhen capturing practice cards, we usually focus on these core elements to the extent that the information is or could be relevant to the problem we explore. Friction can then be observed when either \\*Meanings, Materials \\*or *Competences* (or, of course, a combination thereof) between connected practices do not align. The information from the cards will inform the discussion of how better alignment could be found between those practitioners.\_\_\_\n\nOn the practice card, we decided to replace asking explicitly for competences by asking for “Doing it well’. Answering the question allows us to think about positioning the practice on the Evolution axis as well as implicitly asking for competences.\_\n\nWe often can also describe capabilities with these three elements, which can help understand friction between capabilities. There is a somewhat fractal nature to the lens of practice. We can configure practices into capabilities and practices themselves can often be seen as configurations of smaller practices (e.g. tacit practices or routinized behaviours). Capabilities can then be seen as a higher order system emerging from integrated practices, where their meaning will be different, sometimes transformatively so, but the materials and most required competences will be the same as in the underlying practices.\_\n\nRegarding Simon’s mapping technique, we believe that Maturity Maps are Wardley Maps, i.e. satisfy his criteria for a map, but what we’re mapping is informed by practice theory, i.e. we are taking a different approach than Simon suggests for practices.\_\n\nUsing the lens of practice theory, we could say that Wardley Mapping has a bias for the *material*, for the “thingness” of what is being mapped and Maturity Mapping has bias for *doing*, the socio-material enactments that enable the things. As Maturity Mapping evolves, we expect that deviation to become more articulate. We are relying on Simon’s technique because we have not (yet) found a better visualisation for maturing practices. \n"

      - title: How is it different to maturity models?
        title_align: left
        content: "We understand maturity models as de-contextualised experiences, they are context-free. I.e. the practitioners who create a maturity model are trying to capture the essence of their experience in a way that transcendences the specific contexts in which their experience was gained for the purpose to inform better practice in contexts of those who apply the maturity model. This requires people who want to apply a maturity model to re-contextualise the model to fit the specific environment they’re in.\_\n\nIn our experience, having learned and applied many maturity models (and keep in mind, not all maturity models self-declare as such), one characteristic seems to be always experienced: the ability to re-contextualise the model matters more for a successful application than the depth of expertise in the model. We also often notice that the recontextualisation changes at least some of the model’s assumptions about maturity, because context always matters when we inspect socio-technical dynamics. Therefore some aspects of context that are assumed to be shared by the model are in fact not shared by the context in which it is applied. Also, in context, practices are connected to practices outside of a (context-free) maturity model and those practices influence the maturity of a practice.\_\n\nFrom that perspective, Maturity Mapping is a meta-model, i.e. it is a way in which you can describe AND contextualise any practice-based maturity model. A key difference in Maturity Mapping is that we claim that “better” is only a valid judgement if confirmed by those whose needs we are trying to satisfy by performing the practice and that only practitioners in the context of which we are mapping can make meaningful statements about what is mature or what is not. Maturity mapping will surface faster how any maturity model has to be changed to fit a context than discovering so from failures experienced by practice.\_\n\nThe main difference then to a maturity model is that Maturity Mapping gives you a model that is tailored to your context. It does not even require you to start with an existing maturity model, you can build your own based on your own experience and understanding and it can evolve using the feedback from your efforts of implementing the model.\_\n"

      - title: Why do you focus on practices as the central unit of analysis?
        title_align: left
        content: "By practice, we mean the enactment of an activity in which the practitioner integrates material (e.g. technology) in interactions with other people in a reproducible and recognisable way. Practices have to be socially shared and can be collectively improved.\_\n\nGiven some technical tools and some people we intend to work with, we can produce a broad range of outcomes. It is by performing specific integrations that we achieve specific outcomes and it is by performing these repeatedly and recognisably to reproduce specific outcomes that we can observe such a specific integration as a practice.\_\n\n“*A bad system will beat a good person every time.*” - W. Edwards Deming\_\n\nHow we make the system, in which the work takes place, better is at the center of an ever increasing number of methods. Traditional and popular theories of change overwhelmingly depend on viewing behaviour as a matter of individual choice, routinely linked to personal attitudes (e.g. mindset), influenced by ‘driving’ factors (e.g. policies, company culture, economic and other constraints). This conceptualization of the work misses the extent to which the details, in how we do the work, are anchored in and constitutive of practice.\_\n\n*“Practices constitute and sustain the complex dynamic systems in which they are located and explain the remarkable stability and resistance to change in many everyday activities. Changes in systems happen if the practices that structure the routines and rhythms of our lives evolve.”* (Warde, A., Meier, P. S., & Holmes, J. 2017)\_\n\n“*The performance of a system depends on how its parts fit together, not how they act separately.*” - Russell L. Ackoff ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEeIG8aPPk))\n\nBy visualising work as a network with practices as the constituent parts, we’re focusing on interactions, how the practices fit together, through a socio-technical lens.\_\n\nTo understand a practice, we have to enquire its meaning - why are we enacting the practice, the materials we need (technology, infrastructure, facilities, etc.) and the competences we have to exhibit (skills, timeliness, knowledge, etc.) when performing the practice. We then understand how practices fit together by observing how these elements align across connected practices.\_\_\n\n*“In this analysis, individuals feature as the carriers or hosts of a practice. This is a radical departure from more conventional approaches in which understandings, know-how, meanings and purposes are taken to be personal attributes.”*\n\n(Shove, Elizabeth; Pantzar, Mika; Watson, Matt. 2012)\n\nFocusing on practice allows us to analyse the work without having to speculate about the inner lives of practitioners. Furthermore, the expert of a practice has to be a practitioner, so analysis can not be done for or about the practitioners, but has to be done **with** them.\_\n\nWhile people who benefit from the practice can make judgments on the value it produces, it requires experience in the practice to understand how it, or its integration with other practices, can be improved. Yes, some competences are shared over a large number of contexts, including the competences in using certain materials and technology, but a practice in use in company A will show some variation from a similar practice in company B. When we want to improve how well practices fit together, strengthening the coherence within a capability, then those differences often matter more than what we usually attribute as the common characteristics of the generally known practice.\_\n\nThis means it would be wasteful to articulate ideas for improvements for a given context without basing these on the expertise and experience of practitioners in that context. By focusing on practices as the unit of analysis we articulate change as a reconfiguration of a set of practices, which requires a collective effort and failure can no longer be seen as caused by an individual.\_\n\nFurther reading:\_\n\n[The Dynamics of Social Practice - Everyday Life and how it Changes](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-dynamics-of-social-practice-everyday-life-and-how-it-changes\\(6ba37d6d-5a7a-4f02-b7b1-e734ab36ff0c\\)/export.html)\n\n[Shove, Elizabeth; Pantzar, Mika; Watson, Matt. 2012](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-dynamics-of-social-practice-everyday-life-and-how-it-changes\\(6ba37d6d-5a7a-4f02-b7b1-e734ab36ff0c\\)/export.html)\n"

      - title: Why do you presume that capabilities are composed of practices?
        title_align: left
        content: "There are many ways to understand the word capability. We do not claim that for all these meanings the practice lens is appropriate. What we mean by capability in the context of Maturity Mapping are the higher level abilities to create value that emerge from connected practices. In the language of practice theory, connected practices are complexes or sites, but when we talk about these things in an organisational context, we talk about capabilities that enable an organisation to meet needs, either those of the organisation itself, its customers or its stakeholders.\_\n\nIn all these situations, people have to perform practices to get that work done, i.e. exhibit the capability. They might do so with the help of technology, but even automated processes have to be maintained and, often, corrected or adapted by people. These activities are all practices.\_\n"
