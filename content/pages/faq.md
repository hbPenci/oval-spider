      - title: How will it make me new money?
        content: "Discover new ways of interacting with customers and the wider environment in which the organisation operates by locating friction between practices and/or capabilities in meeting these needs.\_\_\n\nAllow emergence of new capabilities by setting direction (e.g. articulating a new yet unmet need, i.e. new meaning) and using Maturity Mapping to play through new combinations of existing practices and capabilities to meet that need. In combination with carrying out experiments, this is a deliberate form of exaptation (and making exapting a practice in itself). \_ \n"
      - title: How long does it take?
        content: "The short answer is that it depends on the problem we are trying to solve. Maturity Mapping can be scaled to fit the desired size.\_\n\nA single half day mapping session with a small team around a focused problem can produce new insights and options for improvement. To map the capabilities in an agile software team usually requires 3 workshops of 2-3 hours each when facilitated by a Maturity Mapping expert, plus maybe half a day for the analysis and clean up of the artefacts, if that is desirable.\_\n\nInvestigating the problems in cloud adoption for an operational team serving 8 product teams (i.e. 9 teams of various sizes) can be done in a month. Including experiments into the time frame of the mapping exercise can stretch this to 6-7 weeks of work carried out over a period of 3-4 months (depending on the time it takes to carry out the experiments), with most of the facilitated workshops happening in the 1st half.\_\n\nFor any multi-team engagement, time with the leadership will be required as well, up front to scope and plan the engagement, during the actual mapping activity to reframe some of the scope of the engagement based on the feedback from early mapping sessions and at the end to reflect on what was discovered and how to apply it going forward. Again, these need to be facilitated workshops, so add 2-4 weeks for that. \n"
      - title: Whatâ€™s roughly the process?
        content: "Ideally, find someone who can facilitate the process who is not part of the organisation (or organisations) in which you are mapping. This is to minimise bias in the facilitation itself.\_\n\nStart by having a good problem statement (or statements) to frame the scope of the exercise, what needs are to be explored and know who has those needs (because you should consult them when validating if improvements were achieved). If possible, you should capture some hypotheses around what you expect to observe on the maps you intend to make.\_\n\nWe suggest starting with collecting the practices that are performed to meet that need on practice cards. Depending on the problem, you might want to add specific attributes for these practices, but make sure you keep the three core attributes (Meaning, Material, How to do it well).\_\n\nThen place the practices on the map and connect them, they should build a network. If you get a linear, or close to linear, connection of practices, you are likely to have missed important aspects of how the need is met. You might need to observe how the work is getting done to discover these. You want to make all practices that are needed to meet the need visible. \n"
